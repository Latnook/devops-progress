🚀 Exciting Update: Leveling Up Linux Learning! 🐧

I'm thrilled to share a major enhancement to my DevOps Learning Journey repository! The entire "Linux Administration" module (2-linux/) has been completely reworked to provide a more engaging and effective learning experience.

Gone are the days of simple step-by-step instructions. We've transformed all 13 Linux exercises into interactive, problem-based tutorials designed to foster true understanding and command-line mastery.

Key highlights of this rework:
✅ Real-World Scenarios: Each exercise presents practical problems you'd encounter in a DevOps role.
🔍 Self-Discovery Focused: Learners are now encouraged to use 'man' pages and '--help' to independently discover commands and options, moving beyond rote memorization.
✍️ Interactive Validation: Scripts dynamically check your solutions, providing immediate feedback and reinforcing learning.
🧠 Deep Dive into Essentials: Covering everything from filesystem navigation, permissions, I/O redirection, pipes, filters, 'find', 'sed', 'awk', to fundamental Bash scripting.

This new approach is all about empowering hands-on exploration and critical thinking – essential skills for any aspiring or practicing DevOps engineer.

Check out the updated repository and dive into the new interactive Linux challenges! Your feedback is always welcome as I continue to build out this learning resource.
