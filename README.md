# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! On November 10th, 2025, I started my journey to learn DevOps, and this repository will document my progress and showcase the projects I build along the way.

## About This Repository

This is a hands-on learning repository where I'll be practicing and implementing various DevOps concepts, tools, and technologies. Each project represents a new skill or concept I'm learning, with practical implementations and documentation.

## Projects

### 1. Microservices Architecture Demo
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Location:** [`1-microservices_test/`](1-microservices_test/)

A demonstration of microservices architecture featuring three services communicating via REST APIs:
- **Time Service** - Returns current timestamp
- **System Info Service** - Returns hostname and platform information
- **Dashboard Service** - Aggregates data from both services

**Technologies:** Docker, Docker Compose, Python Flask, REST APIs
