# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! On November 11th, 2025, I started my journey to learn DevOps, and this repository will document my progress and showcase the projects I build along the way.

## About This Repository

This is a hands-on learning repository where I'll be practicing and implementing various DevOps concepts, tools, and technologies. Each project represents a new skill or concept I'm learning, with practical implementations and documentation.

## Projects

### 1. Microservices Architecture Demo
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Location:** [`1-microservices_test/`](1-microservices_test/)

A demonstration of microservices architecture featuring four services communicating via REST APIs:
- **Time Service** - Returns current timestamp
- **System Info Service** - Returns detailed system information (OS, CPU, memory, Python version)
- **Weather Service** - Fetches real-time weather data for Haifa, Israel
- **Dashboard Service** - Aggregates data from all services with a web interface

**Technologies:** Docker, Docker Compose, Python Flask, REST APIs, External API Integration

**Features:**
- Service-to-service communication
- Detailed system metrics (CPU cores, memory usage, architecture)
- Real-time weather integration using wttr.in API
- Health checks for all services
- Docker networking and container orchestration
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, Linux, Mac)
