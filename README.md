# DevOps Learning Journey

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository! On November 11th, 2025, I started my journey to learn DevOps, and this repository will document my progress and showcase the projects I build along the way.

## About This Repository

This is a hands-on learning repository where I'll be practicing and implementing various DevOps concepts, tools, and technologies. Each project represents a new skill or concept I'm learning, with practical implementations and documentation.

## Projects

### 1. Polyglot Microservices Architecture Demo
**Status:** ✅ Completed ⭐ **Updated: 2025-11-13**
**Location:** [`1-microservices_test/`](1-microservices_test/)

A demonstration of **polyglot microservices architecture** featuring services written in **Go, Node.js, and Python** communicating seamlessly via REST APIs. This project includes service-to-service communication, Docker containerization, and a complete monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana.

### 2. Interactive Linux & Bash Tutorial
**Status:** ✅ Completed ⭐ **Updated: 2026-01-05**
**Location:** [`2-linux/`](2-linux/)

A comprehensive, hands-on tutorial for mastering the Linux command line. This project was completely reworked from a static guide into a series of 13 interactive, self-correcting shell scripts.

**Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
- **Problem-Based Learning:** Exercises are framed as real-world scenarios, not just instructions to follow.
- **Self-Discovery:** Hints are removed, forcing the use of `man` pages and `--help` to discover command options.
- **Interactive Validation:** Scripts check the user's commands to ensure they achieve the specified goal.
- **Covers 13 Core Topics:** Including filesystem navigation, permissions, I/O redirection, pipes, filters, `find`, `sed`, `awk`, and basic Bash scripting.
